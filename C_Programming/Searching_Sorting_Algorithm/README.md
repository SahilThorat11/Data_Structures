## 📖 Overview

This repository contains my **personal study implementations** of fundamental **Searching and Sorting Algorithms** using the **C programming language**.

The main objective is to build a strong foundation in **Data Structures**, improve **problem-solving skills**, and maintain organized study material for future reference and interview preparation.

This repository is part of my structured learning path in **System Programming and Data Structures**.
